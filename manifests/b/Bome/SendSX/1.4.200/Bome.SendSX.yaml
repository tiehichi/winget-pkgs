ShortDescription: MIDI utility to send SysEx messages
Description: >
  This powerful utility for Windows creates small Sys Ex messages and can send them to any MIDI
  device. It's also a great little MIDI monitor, and can easily test small Sys Ex requests, since
  the reply as well as all other events from the MIDI device are displayed.

  Additional features include loading and saving of Sys Ex files, so you can archive bulk dumps
  from your MIDI device and send them later back to the device.
